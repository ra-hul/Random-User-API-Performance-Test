# Random User API performance Test

## About 
This project demonstrates that we can use JMeter to perform load and stress testing and find the capacity value and bottleneck point for an API/website. 
For this project, the https://randomuser.me/api API is used for checking the maximum load as well as the API's capacity value and bottleneck point

# List of tests
## Load Testing
Basically load testing helps us to make sure that any API can handle a lot of traffic without breaking down. It allows us to find performance issues and help us to solve that
as well as ensuring our system perform goo under heavy use.

## Stress Testing
Stress testing helps us determine the breaking point of any API by pushing it beyond its normal load limits. This helps identify the system's maximum capacity and shows how it behaves under extreme conditions or 
pressure ensuring the performance

## What is capacity analysis and bottleneck Point?
Capacity analysis helps us understand how many users an API can handle before performance starts to fall, shows the system's bottleneck points.That's mean after that point the API/website can't
confim the good performance.
